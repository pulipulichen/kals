<p>ELMS Places integrates Google Maps with your course version.  To associate a place to content, create some content and hit save.  Then highlight the text of your content and you will see a contextual highlighter menu. Click to add a Place to the material and run through the form.  This will bring you back to your content but add a menu tab to the right-hand side of the screen and create a link in the material to the tab.  Clicking the text in the content will open the tab to the map location.</p>
<p>You will also be given a new link under "Course Resources" on the interface that says "Places".  This will display a Google map that has ALL places you have associated to the material.  This can provide a unique way of navigating through location based topics in courses as you can click through to any point on the map to see where it was referenced in the content.</p>
