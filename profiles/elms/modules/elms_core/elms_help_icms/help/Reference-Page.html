      <p>Reference Pages aren't really pages at all.  They allow you to create a direct reference to a page outside of the current course.  How to use this:</p>
<ul><li>Your work unit has standard orientation and policy information that you want to include in the instructional flow of courses</li>
  <li>You create a sandbox called "Our resources" and mark it as "master" in the workflow settings</li>
  <li>Create some pages in Our Resources for the things you want to reference elsewhere</li>
  <li>Go to the course in question, create a Reference Page and start typing the name of what you want to reference.</li>
  <li>It will start to auto complete with a list, select your content and save</li>
</ul><p>When the page goes to load it will display the text from the referenced content.  This allows you to internally cross-link materials as well as update globally since they are managed in a single location.  This is also useful when branching a course into multiple versions or referencing lessons from one course in another.</p>
