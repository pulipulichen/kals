<p>ELMS Terms allows you to create a glossary of terms for a course.  To add something to the glossary, highlight a word in created content and select add glossary term.  An important distinction between glossary terms and other highlighter items is that <em>glossary items will automatically be scanned and associated to content globally once referenced in a course version</em>.</p>
<p>For example: You find the word "Geodesic" to be an important concept.  You highlight the word, provide a definition for it and then anywhere in the course version that Geodesic is used, it will automatically be highlighted.  Clicking the word will slide open a tab on the right side with a list of the terms used in the content.  There is also a Glossary link for the course that aggregates all of these back to a table display.</p>
